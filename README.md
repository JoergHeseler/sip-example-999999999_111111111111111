# SIP Example: 999999999_111111111111111

This repository contains a complete Submission Information Package (SIP) for the digital long-term preservation and physical reproduction of a historical Meissen porcelain figure.

## Background

This dataset is part of the accompanying materials to the guideline
[**“Digitalisierung und Langzeitarchivierung von Porzellanfiguren für ihre Reproduktion”** (Digitization and Digital Preservation of Porcelain Figures for Their Reproduction)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15481636) published as part of the NFDI4Culture community's recommendations.

## Repository Contents

The SIP is located in the folder [999999999_111111111111111](./999999999_111111111111111/)[^1]

Due to legal and rights-related restrictions, only simplified point cloud and mesh models (STL, glTF) could be included in this SIP. These were chosen to illustrate the structure and workflow of digital preservation and reproduction without violating reproduction or copyright regulations.
